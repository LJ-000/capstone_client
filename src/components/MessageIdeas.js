<CardTitle>Get Well Soon Wishes</CardTitle>
<CardSubtitle>If you know the recipient well enough (and you know they’ll appreciate it!), a little humor is sometimes just the thing to brighten someone’s day in the hospital. However, if your colleague is the serious sort or you’re not very close, it’s safer to stick with more formal sentiments. Don't use cliches like, "There must be a reason." These well-known phrases have hardly any meaning, seem insincere, and can offend the ill person.</CardSubtitle>
